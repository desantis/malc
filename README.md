# malc

Mal (Make A Lisp) compiler

## Overview

[Mal](https://github.com/kanaka/mal) is Clojure inspired Lisp language invented
by Joel Martin as a learning tool.  It has interpreter implementations in dozens
of programming languages, including self-hosted interpreter written in Mal
itself.

malc is a compiler for Mal, written in Mal itself.  It compiles a Mal program to
[LLVM assembly language (IR)](http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html), and then uses
the LLVM optimizer, assembler and gcc linker to produce a binary executable.

This project main goal was a way for me to learn about Lisp, compilation and
LLVM.  It is not intended for use in any serious application or system.


## Installation

malc depends on LLVM, of course. Moreover, the executables generated by malc
are dynamically linked with libstdc++ (for exception handling routines), with
the Boehm Garbage Collection shared library (`libgc.so`) and with the readline
shared library.

To install the dependencies on Debian/Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install llvm libstdc++ libgc-dev libreadline6

To install the dependencies on RedHat/CentOS:

    sudo yum install llvm libstdc++ gc-devel readline

Besides these dependencies, malc needs a working Mal interpreter; malc comes
bundled with the Ruby implementation of the Mal interpreter (in
`mal-interpreter` directory) to easier invocation of malc.  Hence, a working
Ruby runtime is required.  Alternatively, you can choose another Mal
implementation using the `MAL_IMPL` environment variable; see below.


## Usage

Run the `malc` wrapper script with the mal program file as the argument:

    ./malc myprogram.mal

If successful, this will generate the executable `myprogram`.  The executable
dynamically links with `libc` and `libgc` (the Boehm Garbage Collection
shared library).

### Adding debug information

If you want to debug the binary (with gdb), use the `-g` switch:

    ./malc -g myprogram.mal

This will instruct the compiler to mark the generated LLVM functions with
`external` linkage type (as opposed to the `private` linkage type).  This
leaves the functions names in the resulting executable, thereby allowing more
readable stack traces; however, it might prevent the optimizer from inlining
some functions.

### Examining generated LLVM IR code

If you want to look at the LLVM code generated by malc, use the `-l` switch:

    ./malc -l myprogram.mal

This will generate `myprogram.ll` (the LLVM code produced by malc),
`myprogram.opt.ll` (LLVM code after the LLVM optimizer) and `myprogram` (the
executable file).

### Choosing the Mal interpreter

By default malc uses the bundled Ruby implementation of Mal to run the
compiler.  Use the `MAL_IMPL` (path to the Mal implementation) and `MAL_PREFIX`
(program which runs the Mal implementation) environment variables to instruct
malc to use another Mal interpreter.  For example:

    MAL_PREFIX=python MAL_IMPL=../mal/python/stepA_mal.py ./malc myprogram.mal

For compiled Mal interpreters just set `MAL_IMPL`; for example:

    MAL_IMPL=../mal/ocaml/stepA_mal ./malc myprogram.mal


## Running tests

The functional tests for malc are in files under the `tests/` directory.

To run all the tests:

    ./runtests.sh

To run a specific test file:

    ./runtests.sh tests/integer_compare.mal


## Running performance tests

The Mal performance tests are copied over and can be run with:

    ./runperf.sh

Please note the caveat from [Mal's own
README](https://github.com/kanaka/mal#performance-tests):

> Warning: These performance tests are neither statistically valid nor
> comprehensive; runtime performance is a not a primary goal of mal. If you
> draw any serious conclusions from these performance tests, then please
> contact me about some amazing oceanfront property in Kansas that I'm willing
> to sell you for cheap.


## Implementation details

See [internals documentation](doc/internals.md).


## Additions to Mal

The following functions were added:

* `(os-exit EXITCODE)` - exits the process with the given integer exit code.
* `(gc-get-heap-size)` - Boehm GC's `GC_get_heap_size()`
* `(gc-get-total-bytes)` - Boehm GC's `GC_get_total_bytes()`

The following variables were added:

* `*ARGV0*` - string which holds the value of argv[0] from the executable
  `main()` entry function.


## What's missing?

A lot. See the [TODO list](doc/TODO.md).
